## What this guide contains
This guide includes **7 core AI specialties**. Each specialty has a detailed Markdown file covering: definition, specialist tasks, sub-domains, expanded key concepts, tools & technologies, an in-depth workflow example, common job roles, and an A–Z glossary.

**The 7 core specialties:**
1. Machine Learning (ML)  
2. Deep Learning (DL)  
3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
4. Computer Vision (CV)  
5. MLOps & ML Engineering  
6. Reinforcement Learning (RL)  
7. AI Safety & Explainability

## How to use this README
1. Read this entry page first to get the overall map, then pick one specialty to dive into. The idea is to grasp the big picture and then focus.  
2. Each specialty file contains practical workflow examples you can implement as portfolio projects. Start with one project and iterate.  
3. Follow the recommended learning paths in each file (from beginner → advanced).  

---

## Suggested learning path (short)
1. Learn Python, Git, and basic SQL.  
2. Start with **Machine Learning** (scikit-learn, essential statistics, small projects).  
3. Move to **Deep Learning** (PyTorch/TensorFlow), apply to images and text.  
4. Try small projects in **NLP** and **CV** (chatbot, object detector).  
5. Learn basic **MLOps** early: packaging, serving, and monitoring.  
6. Explore **RL** and **AI Safety** as advanced topics after a strong foundation.
